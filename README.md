# TPU-MLIR

TPU-MLIR is an open-source machine-learning compiler based on MLIR for TPU. This project provides a complete toolchain, which can convert pre-trained neural networks from different frameworks into binary files `bmodel` that can be efficiently operated on TPUs.

TPU-MLIR is originally developed by SOPHGO. This company is committed to becoming the world's leading general computing power provider. SOPHGO has inherited the technology, patents, products and customers of BITMAIN in the AI field for many years and focused on the R&D, promotion and application of artificial intelligence chips and related products. It has two major brands: SOPHON and CVITEK. With the self-developed chips as the core, SOPHGO has created a matrix of computing power products, which covers the whole scene of "cloud, edge and terminal" and provides computing power products and overall solutions for urban brains, intelligent computing centers, intelligent security, intelligent transportation, safety production, industrial quality inspection, intelligent terminals and others.

For technical details of this project, please refer to: [TPU-MLIR Technical Reference Manual](https://tpumlir.org/en/docs/developer_manual/index.html). We also have a paper introducing the design, <https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.15016>.

Currently, the project supports BM1684X. BM1684, CV183x, CV182x, Mars, and other chips will be supported in the future.

# How to Build

After cloning the code of this project, it needs to be compiled in docker.

* Download the required image from [dockerhub](https://hub.docker.com/r/sophgo/tpuc_dev).

``` shell
docker pull sophgo/tpuc_dev:latest

# myname1234 just a example, you can set your own name
docker run --privileged --name myname1234 -v $PWD:/workspace -it sophgo/tpuc_dev:latest
```

After the container is created, the directory of the code in docker should be `/workspace/tpu-mlir`.

* Building

Run the following command in the project directory:

``` shell
cd tpu-mlir
source ./envsetup.sh
./build.sh
```

# How to Test

``` shell
# This project contains the yolov5s.onnx model, which can be used directly for verification
pushd regression
./run_model.sh yolov5s
popd
```

**Options:**

If you want to verify more networks, you need to clone them first. Please refer to <https://github.com/sophgo/model-zoo>.

After cloning, the model path should be `/workspace/model-zoo`, and then use the following command to verify:

``` shell
# This step can also be skipped since its execution time is quite long
pushd regression
./run_all.sh
popd
```

# Usage

Introduce the usage of `TPU-MLIR` by a simple example of compiling `yolov5s.onnx` and running it on the BM1684X TPU platform.

The model comes from the official website of yolov5: <https://github.com/ultralytics/yolov5/releases/download/v6.0/yolov5s.onnx>.

It has been placed in project path `model/yolov5s.onnx`.

## Preparation

Firstly, create a `model_yolov5s` directory at the same level directory with this project. Then put both model and image files into it.

The operation is as follows:

``` shell
mkdir model_yolov5s && cd model_yolov5s
cp ${REGRESSION_PATH}/model/yolov5s.onnx .
cp -rf ${REGRESSION_PATH}/dataset/COCO2017 .
cp -rf ${REGRESSION_PATH}/image .
mkdir workspace && cd workspace
```
## Model to MLIR

If the model takes images as input, we need to learn its preprocessing before transforming. No preprocessing needs to be considered if the input is npz file. The preprocessing process is formulated as follows:

$$
y = （x - mean） \times scale,
$$

where `x` represents the input.

The input of the official yolov5 is RGB image. Each value will be multiplied by `1/255`. Mean and scale are `0.0, 0.0, 0.0` and `0.0039216, 0.0039216, 0.0039216` respectively.

The model conversion command:

``` shell
model_transform.py \
    --model_name yolov5s \
    --model_def ../yolov5s.onnx \
    --input_shapes [[1,3,640,640]] \
    --mean 0.0,0.0,0.0 \
    --scale 0.0039216,0.0039216,0.0039216 \
    --keep_aspect_ratio \
    --pixel_format rgb \
    --output_names 350,498,646 \
    --test_input ../image/dog.jpg \
    --test_result yolov5s_top_outputs.npz \
    --mlir yolov5s.mlir
```

## MLIR to INT8 bmodel

Before converting to the INT8 model, you need to run calibration to get the calibration table. The number of input data is about 100 to 1000 according to the situation.

Then use the calibration table to generate a symmetric or asymmetric bmodel. It is generally not recommended to use the asymmetric one if the symmetric one already meets the requirements, because
the performance of the asymmetric model will be slightly worse than the symmetric model.

Here is an example of the existing 100 images from COCO2017 to perform calibration:

``` shell
run_calibration.py yolov5s.mlir \
  --dataset ../COCO2017 \
  --input_num 100 \
  -o yolov5s_cali_table
```


Execute the following command to convert to the INT8 symmetric quantized model:

``` shell
model_deploy.py \
  --mlir yolov5s.mlir \
  --quantize INT8 \
  --calibration_table yolov5s_cali_table \
  --chip bm1684x \
  --test_input yolov5s_in_f32.npz \
  --test_reference yolov5s_top_outputs.npz \
  --tolerance 0.85,0.45 \
  --model yolov5s_1684x_int8_sym.bmodel
```

To the INT8 asymmetric quantized model:

``` shell
model_deploy.py \
  --mlir yolov5s.mlir \
  --quantize INT8 \
  --asymmetric \
  --calibration_table yolov5s_cali_table \
  --chip bm1684x \
  --test_input yolov5s_in_f32.npz \
  --test_reference yolov5s_top_outputs.npz \
  --tolerance 0.90,0.55 \
  --model yolov5s_1684x_int8_asym.bmodel
```

## Results Comparison

This project has a yolov5 sample written in python (path:  `python/samples/detect_yolov5.py`) for object detection. Read the code to learn how the model is used:
  1. preprocess the input
  2. model inference to get output
  3. post-process the output

The following code is used to verify the output of onnx/f32/int8 model respectively:

* ONNX model:

``` shell
detect_yolov5.py \
  --input ../image/dog.jpg \
  --model ../yolov5s.onnx \
  --output dog_onnx.jpg
```


* F32 bmodel:

``` shell
detect_yolov5.py \
  --input ../image/dog.jpg \
  --model yolov5s_1684x_f32.bmodel \
  --output dog_f32.jpg
```



* INT8 **symmetric quantized** bmodel:

``` shell
detect_yolov5.py \
  --input ../image/dog.jpg \
  --model yolov5s_1684x_int8_sym.bmodel \
  --output dog_int8_sym.jpg
```



* INT8 **asymmetric quantized** bmodel:

``` shell
detect_yolov5.py \
  --input ../image/dog.jpg \
  --model yolov5s_1684x_int8_asym.bmodel \
  --output dog_int8_asym.jpg
```

# Auxiliary Tools

## Model Inference Tool `model_runner.py`

Supports bmodel/mlir/onnx/tflite.

``` shell
model_runner.py \
  --input resnet18_in_f32.npz \
  --model resnet18_1684x_f32.bmodel \
  --output resnet18_output.npz
```

## Tool for `bmodel`

The `bmodel` file can be viewed and edited by `model_tool`:

```
  model_tool
    --info model_file : show brief model info
    --print model_file : show detailed model info
    --extract model_file : extract one multi-net bmodel to multi one-net bmodels
    --combine file1 .. fileN -o new_file: combine bmodels to one bmodel by filepath
    --combine_dir dir1 .. dirN -o new_dir: combine bmodels to one bmodel by directory path
    --dump model_file start_offset byte_size out_file: dump binary data to file from bmodel
```

For example, to get basic information of `bmodel`:

``` shell
model_tool --info resnet18_1684x_f32.bmodel
```
