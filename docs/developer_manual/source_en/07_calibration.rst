Calibration
============

General introduction
--------------------

Calibration is the use of real scene data to tune the proper quantization parameters. Why do we need calibration? When we perform asymmetric quantization of the activation, we need to know the overall dynamic range, i.e., the minmax value, in advance. When applying symmetric quantization to activations, we need to use a suitable quantization threshold algorithm to calculate the quantization threshold based on the overall data distribution of the activation. However, the general trained model does not have the activation statistics. Therefore, both of them need to inference on a miniature sub-training set to collect the output activation of each layer.

The calibration process in tpu-mlir includes automatic threshold search method (search_threshold), cross-layer weight equalization (we), bias correction (bc), and an automatic mixed precision feature (search_qtable), among other methods. The overall process is shown in(:ref:`quantization_process`). Among these, we, bc, search_qtable, and search_threshold are optional and can be combined according to the actual situation of the model to be quantized. Subsequent sections will also provide specific instructions for the use of each method.
The above processes are integrated and executed collectively, and the optimized thresholds and min/max values of each operation are output to a quantization calibration parameter file called "cali_table." Subsequently, in the "model_deploy.py" script, these parameters can be used for further int8 quantization. If you have utilized the automatic mixed-precision feature, along with generating the "cali_table," a mixed-precision table "qtable" will also be produced. In the following "model_deploy.py" script, both of these files are required for subsequent int8 mixed-precision quantization.

   * - Original Image
     - For CNN-like vision networks, image input is supported. Image preprocessing arguments must be the same as in training step when generating the mlir file by model_transform.py.
   * - npz or npy file
     - For cases where non-image inputs or image preprocessing types are not supported at the moment, it is recommended to write an additional script to save the preprocessed input data into npz/npy files (npz file saves multiple tensors in the dictionary, and npy file only contains one tensor). run_calibration.py supports direct input of npz/npy files.

There is no need to specify the preprocessing parameters for the above two formats when calling run_calibration.py to call the mlir file for inference.

Quantization Threshold Algorithm Implementation
------------------------------------------------

tpu-mlir currently implements seven quantization threshold calculation methods: Kullback-Leibler divergence with auto-tuning (kld+auto-tune), Octav (octav), MinMax, Percentile (percentile9999), ACIQ with Gaussian assumption and auto-tuning (aciq_gauss+auto-tune), ACIQ with Laplace assumption and auto-tuning (aciq_laplace+auto-tune), and a histogram-based algorithm derived from Torch. Below, we will introduce the KLD, Octav, ACIQ, and auto-tune algorithms.

KLD Algorithm
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The KLD algorithm implemented by tpu-mlir refers to the implementation of tensorRT. In essence, it cuts off some high-order outliers (the intercepted position is fixed at 128 bin, 256bin ... until 2048 bin) from the distribution of abs (fp32_tensor) (represented by the histogram of 2048 fp32 bins) to get the fp32 reference probability distribution P. This fp32 distribution is expressed in terms of 128 ranks of int8 type. By merging multiple adjacent bins (e.g., 256 bins are 2 adjacent fp32 bins) into 1 rank of int8 values, calculating the distribution probability, and then expanding bins to ensure the same length as P, the probability distribution Q of the quantized int8 values can be got. The KL divergences of P and Q are calculated for the interception positions of 128bin, 256bin, ..., and 2048 bin, respectively in each loop until the interception with the smallest divergence is found. Interception here means the probability distribution of fp32 can be best simulated with the 128 quantization levels of int8. Therefore, it is most appropriate to set the quantization threshold here. The pseudo-code for the implementation of the KLD algorithm is shown below:


.. code-block:: shell
   :linenos:

   the pseudocode of computing int8 quantize threshold by kld:
       Prepare fp32 histogram H with 2048 bins
       compute the absmax of fp32 value

       for i in range(128,2048,128):
         Outliers_num=sum(bin[i], bin[i+1],…, bin[2047])
         Fp32_distribution=[bin[0], bin[1],…, bin[i-1]+Outliers_num]
         Fp32_distribution/= sum(Fp32_distribution)

         int8_distribution = quantize [bin[0], bin[1],…, bin[i]] into 128 quant level
         expand int8_distribution to i bins
         int8_distribution /= sum(int8_distribution)
         kld[i] = KLD(Fp32_distribution, int8_distribution)
       end for

       find i which kld[i] is minimal
       int8 quantize threshold = (i + 0.5)*fp32 absmax/2048



Auto-tune Algorithm
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

From the actual performance of the KLD algorithm, its candidate threshold is relatively coarse and does not take into account the characteristics of different scenarios, such as object detection and key point detection, in which tensor outliers may be more important to the performance. In these cases, a larger quantization threshold is required to avoid saturation which will affect the expression of distribution features. In addition, the KLD algorithm calculates the quantization threshold based on the similarity between the quantized int8 and the fp32 probability distribution, while there are other methods to evaluate the distribution similarity such as Euclidean distance, cos similarity, etc. These metrics evaluate the tensor numerical distribution similarity directly without the need for a coarse interception threshold, which most of the time has better performance. Therefore, with the basis of efficient KLD quantization threshold, tpu-mlir proposes the auto-tune algorithm to fine-tune these activations quantization thresholds based on Euclidean distance metric, which ensures a better accuracy performance of its int8 quantization.

Implementation: firstly, uniformly pseudo-quantize layers with weights in the network, i.e., quantize their weights from fp32 to int8, and then de-quantize to fp32 for introducing quantization error. After that, tune the input activation quantization threshold of op one by one (i.e., uniformly select 20 candidates among the initial KLD quantization threshold and maximum absolute values of activations. Use these candidates to quantize fp32 reference activation values for introducing quantization error. Input op for fp32 calculation, calculating the Euclidean distance between the output and the fp32 reference activations. The candidate with a minimum Euclidean distance will be selected as the tuning threshold). For the case where the output of one op is connected to multiple subsequent ones, the quantization thresholds are calculated for the multiple branches according to the above method, and then the larger one is taken. For instance, the output of layer1 will be adjusted for layer2 and layer3 respectively as shown in the figure (:ref:`auto_tune_flow`).

   Implementation of auto-tune

Octav Algorithm
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The OCTAV algorithm implemented by tpu-mlir is based on the paper "Optimal Clipping and Magnitude-aware Differentiation for Improved Quantization-aware Training." It is commonly believed that quantization error stems from rounding error and truncation error. Computing the optimal truncation (threshold) for each tensor can minimize the quantization error. OCTAV uses mean squared error (MSE) to measure quantization error and employs a recursive approach based on the fast Newton-Raphson method to dynamically determine the optimal threshold that minimizes MSE. Below is the iterative formula for computing the optimal threshold using this method, as illustrated in figure (:ref:`octav`).

.. _octav:
.. figure:: ../assets/octav.png
   :align: center

   octav迭代公式

It was initially designed for use in Quantization-Aware Training (QAT), but it is also effective in Post-Training Quantization (PTQ). Below is the pseudocode for its implementation:

.. code-block:: shell
   :linenos:

   the pseudocode of computing int8 quantize threshold by octav:
       Prepare T: Tensor to be quantized,
               B: Number of quantization bits,
               epsilon: Convergence threshold (e.g., 1e-5),
               s_0: Initial guess for the clipping scalar (e.g., max absolute value in tensor T)
       compute s_star: Optimal clipping scalar

       for n in range(20):
          Compute the indicator functions for the current clipping scalar:
          I_clip = 1{|T| > s_n}  (applied element-wise to tensor T)
          I_disc = 1{0 < |T| ≤ s_n}

          Update the clipping scalar s_n to the next one s_(n+1) using:
          s_(n+1) = (Σ|x| * I_clip) / ((4^{-B} / 3) * ΣI_disc + ΣI_clip)
          where Σ denotes the summation over the corresponding elements

          If |s_(n+1) - s_n| < epsilon, the algorithm is considered to have converged
       end for
       s_star = s_n

Aciq Algorithm
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The ACIQ algorithm implemented in TPU-MLIR is based on the paper "ACIQ: Analytical Clipping for Integer Quantization of Neural Networks." This method assumes that the activation values follow a fixed distribution, then calculates the statistical measures of the corresponding distribution of the activation values, and derives the optimal threshold based on the theoretically calculated optimal clipping quantile.

Implementation approach: TPU-MLIR provides two variants of the algorithm, aciq_gauss and aciq_laplace, which assume Gaussian and Laplace distributions for the activation values. Then, based on the optimal clipping quantile corresponding to 8-bit theoretically, the optimal threshold is calculated.

optimization algorithms Implementation
------------------------------------------------

During the calibration process, to further enhance the precision of the quantized model, TPU-MLIR offers a variety of optimization algorithms, including Cross-Layer Weight Equalization (WE), Bias Correction (BC), search_qtable, and search_threshold. Below is an introduction to the aforementioned optimization algorithms.

we Algorithm
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The cross-layer weight equalization algorithm implemented in TPU-MLIR is based on the paper "Data-Free Quantization Through Weight Equalization and Bias Correction." This method primarily targets model weights and equalizes weights that fit the patterns of conv-conv and conv-relu-conv, aiming to make the distribution of two adjacent weights as uniform as possible.

Previous studies have found that in networks with a high number of depthwise separable convolutions, such as MobileNet, there is a significant variation in the data distribution across channels. This variation can lead to substantial quantization errors when per-layer quantization is used. The WE algorithm effectively addresses this issue by leveraging the linear characteristics of the ReLU function, allowing for the equalization of adjacent convolutional weights.
This equalization reduces the distribution disparity between convolutional channels, enabling per-layer quantization to achieve results comparable to per-channel quantization. The technical principle is illustrated in the figure (:ref:`we`).

.. _we:
.. figure:: ../assets/weq.png
   :align: center

   weight_equalization

bc Algorithm
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The bias correction algorithm implemented in TPU-MLIR is referenced from the paper "Data-Free Quantization Through Weight Equalization and Bias Correction." It's commonly assumed that the output error of a quantized model is unbiased, meaning its expected value is zero. However, in many practical scenarios, the output error of a quantized model is biased, indicating a deviation in the expected value between the outputs of the quantized model and the floating-point model. This deviation can impact the accuracy of the quantized model.

The bias correction algorithm calculates the statistical deviation between the quantized model and the floating-point model on calibration data. It then compensates for this deviation by adjusting the bias term of Conv/Gemm operators in the model, aiming to minimize the expected value deviation between their outputs as much as possible. The effect is illustrated in the figure(:ref:`bc`).

.. _bc:
.. figure:: ../assets/bias.png
   :align: center

   bias_correction

search_threshold Algorithm
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

TPU-MLIR offers seven independent threshold calculation methods, and when we have a model that needs to be quantized, choosing the best threshold calculation method becomes an issue. search_threshold provides a solution for this problem.

Implementation: search_threshold initially computes the threshold values using four methods: kld+tune, octav, max, and percentile9999. It then calculates the similarity between the outputs of the quantized model generated by different threshold values and the floating-point model. By comparing the similarity of the four threshold methods, the threshold value corresponding to the highest similarity is selected as the quantization parameter for the current model.
During the use of search_threshold, the following points need to be noted: 1. search_threshold currently offers two similarity calculation methods, cos and snr, with cos being the default method. 2. If the cos similarity between the quantized model and the floating-point model is below 0.9, the accuracy of the quantized model may be significantly reduced. Search_threshold results may not be accurate. After performing actual accuracy validation, it is recommended to try mixed precision with search_qtable.

search_qtable Algorithm
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

search_qtable is an automatic mixed-precision functionality integrated into the calibration process. When the accuracy of a fully int8 quantized model does not meet the requirements, you can try enabling the search_qtable algorithm. This algorithm is faster compared to run_sensitive_lyer. It also offers the ability to mix custom threshold algorithms and automatically generate a qtable.

Implementation: The output of search_qtable will generate mixed thresholds, meaning it performs optimal selection for the threshold of each layer of the model. That is, it chooses the best result from multiple threshold calculation methods specified by the user for each layer. This choice is based on the comparison of the similarity between the quantized model's current layer output and the original model's current layer output. In addition to generating mixed thresholds, search_qtable will also output the layers of the model that are mixed precision.
When the user specifies the desired similarity between the mixed precision model and the original model's output, search_qtable will automatically output the minimum number of mixed precision layers required to achieve that similarity level.

Areas of the UI is marked with light blue rectangle for reference, dark green comments on the areas, includeing:
   1. working directory and net file indication
   2. accuracy summary area
   3. layer information area
   4. graph display area
   5. tensor data compare figure area
   6. infomation summary and tensor distribution area (by switching tabs)

With scroll wheel over graph display area, the displayed net graph can be zoomed in and out, and hover or click on the nodes (layer), the attributes of
it will be displayed in the layer information card, by clicking on the edges (tensor), the compare of tensor data in float and quantized net is displayed
in tensor data compare figure, and by clicking on the dot in accuracy summary or information list cells, the layer/tensor will be located in graph display
area.

**Notice: the net graph is displayed according to quantized net, and there may be difference in it comparing to float net, some layer/tensor may not exist in
float net, but the data is copied from quantized net for compare, so the accuracy may seem perfect, but in fact, it should be ignored. Typical layer is Cast
layer in quantized net, in following picture, the non-exist tensor data type will be NA.**
**Notice: without --debug parameter in deployment of the net, some essential intermediate files needed by visual tool would have been deleted by default,
please re-deploy with --debug parameter.**

information displayed on edge (tensor) is illustrated as following:
