oneAPI Deep Neural Network Library (oneDNN)
===========================================

oneAPI Deep Neural Network Library (oneDNN) is an open-source cross-platform
performance library of basic building blocks for deep learning applications.
oneDNN is part of oneAPI (https://oneapi.io).
The library is optimized for Intel(R) Architecture Processors and Intel Graphics.

oneDNN is intended for deep learning applications and framework
developers interested in improving application performance
on Intel CPUs and GPUs.

This package contains oneDNN v3.1.0 (5aabea153825347afa92a2d9f69dd893246bea45).

You can find information about the latest version and release notes
at the oneDNN Github (https://github.com/oneapi-src/oneDNN/releases).

Documentation
-------------

* Developer guide (https://oneapi-src.github.io/oneDNN/v3.1)
  explains the programming model, supported functionality, and implementation
  details, and includes annotated examples.
* API reference (https://oneapi-src.github.io/oneDNN/v3.1/modules.html)
provides a comprehensive reference of the library API.

System Requirements
-------------------

oneDNN supports systems based on Intel 64 or AMD64 architectures.

The library is optimized for the following CPUs:
* Intel Atom(R) processor (at least Intel SSE4.1 support is required)
* Intel Core(TM) processor (at least Intel SSE4.1 support is required)
* Intel Xeon(R) processor E3, E5, and E7 family (formerly Sandy Bridge,
  Ivy Bridge, Haswell, and Broadwell)
* Intel Xeon Scalable processor (formerly Skylake, Cascade Lake, Cooper
  Lake, Ice Lake, and Sapphire Rapids)
* Intel Xeon CPU Max Series (formerly Sapphire Rapids HBM)
* future Intel Xeon Scalable processor (code name Granite Rapids)

oneDNN detects the instruction set architecture (ISA) at runtime and uses
just-in-time (JIT) code generation to deploy the code optimized
for the latest supported ISA. Future ISAs may have initial support in the
library disabled by default and require the use of run-time controls to enable
them. See CPU dispatcher control (https://oneapi-src.github.io/oneDNN/dev_guide_cpu_dispatcher_control.html)
for more details.

The library is optimized for the following GPUs:
* Intel Processor Graphics based on Gen9, Gen9.5 and Gen11, and Gen12 architectures
* Intel Iris(R) Xe graphics (formerly DG1)
* Intel Arc(TM) graphics (formerly Alchemist and DG2)
* Intel Data Center GPU Flex Series (formerly Arctic Sound-M)
* Intel Data Center GPU Max Series (formerly Ponte Vecchio)
